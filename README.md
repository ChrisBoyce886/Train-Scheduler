# Train Scheduler

This game is my Unit 6 homework submission for UNC Charlotte's Coding Bootcamp.  

The objective of this assignment was to build an interactive train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and 
departure data. The application will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. The website will provide up-to-date 
information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

The application is to be built with HTML that is dynamically updated using Javascript and the jQuery library. The webpage also needs to 
pull data from a Firebase database and incorporate Moment.js to manipulate and display data in correct time formats.
